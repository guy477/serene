This repository contains a barebones implementation of Texas Hold'em written in Cython 0.29.28 (Python 3.8.8).


The functionality defined is to be integrated with a CFR algorithm written in Cython. This CFR implementation will eventually be linked with an abstraction algorithm I've previously worked on.


End goal is to create an efficient (and scalable) implementation of poker that serves a dual purpose of being a GTO solver and a practice environment for a learning player.
